# space3d.js
An extension to my 3d.js, but with some functions and classes specifically meant for making things related to space (travel).

Disclaimer:
This was heavily inspired by Daniel Shiffman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzsgS19RRc8, http://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/112-3d-rendering.html). I modified the code to work in javascript and I added quite a lot of features. Still, the foundation isn't mine.
